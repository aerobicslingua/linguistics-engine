2
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.400
Mathematicians won the war.

3
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.190
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

4
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.320
...and built the A-bomb.

5
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.410
Mathematicians, like you.

6
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.410
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

7
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.960
In medicine or economics...

8
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
...in technology or space...

9
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.460
...battle lines are being drawn.

10
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.800
To triumph, we need results...

11
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.010
...publishable, applicable results.

12
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.970
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

13
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.270
The next Einstein?

14
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.600
Who among you will be
the vanguard of democracy...

15
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.810
...freedom, and discovery?

16
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.650
Today, we bequeath America's future
into your able hands.

17
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.610
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

18
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.630
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.680
No, he wants it all for himself.

20
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.350
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

21
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.770
He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.

22
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.150
They're only taking one this year.

23
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.110
Hansen's used to being picked first.

24
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.860
Yeah, he's wasted on math.

25
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150
He should be running for president.

26
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.870
There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.

27
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.840
Thank you.

28
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.970
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

29
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.100
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

30
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.180
At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

31
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.440
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

32
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.560
- And you are?
- Am I late?

33
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.570
- Yes, Mr. Sol.
- Oh, good. Hi.

34
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.110
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.

35
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.570
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

36
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.280
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

37
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.080
- Bender.
- Nice to see you.

38
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.910
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.750
I'll take another.

40
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.120
Excuse me?

41
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.460
Pardon me. I assumed you were the waiter.

42
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.210
- Play nice.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

43
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.630
Honest mistake.

44
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.670
Well, Martin Hansen.

45
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.550
It is Martin, isn't it?

46
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.720
Why, yes, John, it is.

47
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.310
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

48
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.940
I've read your preprints...

49
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.440
...both of them.

50
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.190
The one on Nazi ciphers...

51
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.740
...and the other one
on nonlinear equations...

52
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.660
...and I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal...

53
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.410
...or innovative idea
in either one of them.

54
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.120
Enjoy your punch.

55
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.090
Gentlemen, meet John Nash...

56
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.090
...the mysterious West Virginia genius.

57
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.180
The other winner
of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

58
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.890
- Okay.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.260
Of course.

60
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.460
Oh, Christ.

61
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.260
The prodigal roommate arrives.

62
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.930
Roommate?

63
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.350
Oh, God, no.

64
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.770
Did you know that having a hangover...

65
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.690
...is not having enough water
in your body...

66
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.730
...to run your Krebs cycle?

67
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.110
Which is exactly what happens to you
when you're dying of thirst.

68
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.320
So, dying of thirst...

69
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.490
...would probably feel...

70
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.330
...pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.

71
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.840
John Nash?

72
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.550
Hello.

73
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.260
Charles Herman.

74
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.130
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.850
All right! Well done!

76
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.150
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

77
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.450
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnny Walker.

78
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.540
Whew.

79
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.960
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

80
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.330
...English department cocktails.

81
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.880
Cock was mine...

82
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.380
...the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion for...

83
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.220
...D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?

84
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.970
- I'm here to work.
- Are you? Right.

85
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.850
I see. Crikey!

86
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.900
Is my roommate a dick?

87
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.570
Hmm?

88
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.530
Listen.

89
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.660
If we can't break the ice...

90
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.540
...how about we drown it?

91
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.470
So what's your story?

92
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.760
You the poor kid that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

93
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.430
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.

94
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.230
I have a chip on both shoulders.

95
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.030
Maybe you're just better with the old
integers than you are with people.

96
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.860
My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain...

97
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.990
...but only half a helping of heart.

98
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.530
Wow! She sounds lovely!

99
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.370
The truth is that I...

100
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.370
I don't like people much.

101
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.830
And they don't much like me.

102
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.880
But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?

103
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.170
Seriously, John.

104
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.430
Mathematics...

105
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.720
Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

106
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.520
And you know why?

107
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.600
Because it's boring. It's really boring.

108
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.860
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

109
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.400
I cannot waste time
with these classes and...

110
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.280
...these books.

111
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.660
Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

112
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.460
I need to look through...

113
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.960
...to the governing dynamics.

114
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.800
Find a truly original idea.

115
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.640
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

116
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.430
- It's the only way that I'll ever...
- Matter.

117
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.930
Yes.

118
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.650
- All right, who's next?
- I've played enough go for today.

119
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.480
- Come on.
- I hate this game.

120
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.230
Cowards, all of you!

121
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.490
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

122
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.120
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.

123
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.200
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.

124
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.370
- Look at him.
- Nash!

125
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.290
Taking a reverse constitutional?

126
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.840
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

127
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.170
Oh.

128
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.880
Psycho.

129
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.510
I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...

130
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.890
Classes will dull your mind.

131
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.140
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

132
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.900
Oh, I didn't know that.

133
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.320
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

134
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.740
Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

135
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.530
You scared?

136
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.240
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

137
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.990
Stupefied by you.

138
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.620
No starch.

139
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.710
Pressed and folded.

140
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.670
Let me ask you something, John.

141
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.340
Be my guest, Martin.

142
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.510
Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Peron’s conjectures.

143
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.260
Adequate work...

144
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.720
...without innovation.

145
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.520
- I'm flattered. You flattered?
- Flattered.

146
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.850
And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.

147
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.900
Derivative drivel.

148
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.280
But Nash achievements: zero.

149
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.490
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?

150
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.080
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

151
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.120
How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...

152
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.380
...and you're not?

153
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.380
What if you lose?

154
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.020
You should not have won.

155
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.850
Hmm.

156
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.980
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.

157
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.780
The hubris of the defeated.

158
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.440
The game is flawed.

159
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.000
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

160
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.960
You've been in here for two days.

161
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.430
You know Hansen
has just published another paper?

162
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.100
I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

163
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.770
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

164
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.650
This is a group playing touch football.

165
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.400
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.

166
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.360
And this is a woman who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

167
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.240
John, you watched a mugging.

168
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.910
That's weird.

169
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.660
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

170
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.290
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

171
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.880
See, if I could derive an equilibrium...

172
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.340
...where prevalence is
a non-singular event...

173
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.590
...where nobody loses.

174
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.140
Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...

175
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.220
When did you last eat?

176
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.890
- When did you last eat?
- Currency exchange?

177
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.730
You know, food.

178
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.940
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know?

179
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.400
Yes. But pizza...

180
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.700
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

181
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.580
And, of course, beer.

182
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.250
I have respect for beer.

183
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.670
I have respect for beer!

184
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.060
- Good evening, Neils.
- Hey, Nash.

185
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.980
Who's winning? You or you?

186
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.600
- Good evening, Nash.
- Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

187
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.690
He's looking at you for sure.

188
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.740
Hey, Nash.

189
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.240
Neils is trying to get your attention.

190
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.290
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

191
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.710
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

192
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.920
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

193
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.930
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

194
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.220
...dramatically improve
with each attempt?

195
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.320
This is going to be classic.

196
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.020
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

197
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.440
I don't know what I'm required to say...

198
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.110
...in order for you
to have intercourse with me...

199
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.820
...but could we assume
that I've said all that?

200
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.070
Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?

201
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.370
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

202
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.830
Oh, that was sweet.

203
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.830
Have a nice night, asshole!

204
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.040
Ladies, wait!

205
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.880
I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was...

206
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.300
...really charming.

207
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.100
Walk with me, John.

208
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.690
I've been meaning to talk with you.

209
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.480
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

210
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.400
We're deciding
which placement applications to support.

211
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.860
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.

212
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.700
Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

213
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.990
Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers.
They've published.

214
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.950
I'm still searching, sir, for my...

215
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.370
- Your original idea.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

216
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.460
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.

217
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.390
- May I?
- Thank you.

218
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.430
I'm working on manifold embedding.

219
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.850
My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.

220
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.180
If you could just arrange another
meeting with Professor Einstein.

221
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.400
I've repeatedly asked you for that.

222
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.860
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

223
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.270
John.

224
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.950
Do you see what they're doing there?

225
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.660
Congratulations, Professor Max.
